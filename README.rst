How it works
-------------------

Overburn uses an HTML session using sweeze's NSDotPy library. Using this session, it will load the reports page and handle bans. To abide by NS rules, loading the reports page and banning are done manually. 

Please note that if you log into a nation, it will stop functioning and you will have to manually input a login session. NSDotPy also uses the keyboard function, meaning it will work regardless if you are not on the tab of this script.

Use
-----------------------

Overburn allows you to set keybinds, set different parameters for the reports page, and logs you in just in case you happen to sign into your nation from another browser/script.
